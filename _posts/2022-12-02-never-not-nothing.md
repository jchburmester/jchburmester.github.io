<br />

we know we couldn't<br />
we know it ought to fail<br />
we know they wouldn't<br />
we know we should prevail

a novel moment at will<br />
in between words<br />
in between lines<br />
never have we met<br />
just you and me<br />
a quick look<br />
a smile.

we know we could<br />
we know it ought to appease<br />
we know they wouldn't<br />
we know we shouldn't please

a peaceful protest<br />
in between notion<br />
in between affect<br />
not expected, yet desired<br />
just you and me<br />
a quick look<br />
a smile.

we know we shouldn't<br />
we know it ought to be<br />
we know they wouldn't<br />
we know we could flee

a pristine thread<br />
in between ties<br />
in between space<br />
nothing else matters<br />
just you and me<br />
a quick look<br />
a smile.
