<br />

one day<br />
we wake up<br />
and enter this world<br />

at a random place.<br />
at a random time.

breathing in, energised and vigorous<br />
breathing out, drained and vulnerable 

only together we exist<br />
only together we are

a cloud that dares not to disappear<br />
a stream that ever evolves

residing in amongst us all<br />
hiding preciously

traces of ideas and support<br />
fragments of identity and accord

no matter who and where we were<br />
we matter how and when we are

one day<br />
we go back to sleep<br />
and leave this world

at a not so random place.<br />
at a not so random time.
