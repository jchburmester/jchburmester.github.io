<br />

In forests of gloom I want to despair<br />
until resolve and trust guide my way<br />
until discord and doubts disappear

In the pouring rain I want to dwell<br />
until moods and spirit flow together<br />
until comfort and ease wash away

In deafening silence I want to crouch<br />
until senses and emotions begin to rear<br />
until futility and fraud scurry off

I want to roam in dreary lands and hidden valleys<br />
until morale and grace take me by the hand<br />
until I am nourished from my closest fears

I want to recline in the fierce cold<br />
until gumption and purpose condense<br />
until stress and insecurity start to freeze

I want to be taken up by the gusting winds<br />
until openness and respect take root<br />
until every place feels like home.

I want to seek the unknown and let it seek me<br />
I want to trial the unimaginable and let it trial me<br />
I want to chase life and let it chase me

from every cove and every creek<br />
to every pit and every peak<br />
from every reach and every river<br />
to every sea and every shiver

allow me to think that time is short<br />
allow me to sail from port to port<br />
allow me to embrace now ever more<br />
allow me to say, I'm in for all.
