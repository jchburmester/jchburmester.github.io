![fallen army](/P1050119.jpg){:.ioda}

Like soldiers feared the gun,__
flowers now dread the sun.__
In the heat of the battle they freeze,__
hanging heads, hoping to breathe.

Once we protected a throne,__
leaving behind blood and bone.__
We fought war after war,__
I wonder: what was all this for?

Like an infantry we follow,__
acting childish, short-sighted and hollow,__
the fatal quest for endless growth.__
Yet on us it is – the soldier’s oath.

Mother nature is in danger__
but, for many she is a stranger.__
We live here on her grant,__
nourish from her grace and plant.

We imagine us to be elegant.__
Rather, we are merely arrogant.__
Only a few pay due respect,__
too scarce the clamour to reflect. 

Heavy and thick lies__
above and before our eyes__
the gently rising grime.__
When was the last time__
you sensed a bee?__
Have we become too blind to see?

Does it rest in our core__
that we always strive for more?__
Perhaps less was not on the table__
or were we just not able__
to spot it beneath the masses__
of stuffed plates and glasses?

It’s our duty to sow the seed__
and refuse to grow our killing greed.__
Through our minds we need to wander__
and find the courage to ponder__
about who we truly are,__
about our place under the red star.

Among the soldiers I can hear__
a melody spreading from ear to ear.__
The foe is on the way,__
threatening to scupper and slay.__
For us there is no harm to see,__
will we face the same destiny?

Let us re-connect with our inner spirits and find a way to live in piece with nature and the people around us.

Go out, explore and learn to appreciate this so unlikely chance we have in order to do good and live on this beautiful and fascinating planet with care – it simply is too precious not to.

Whether it is already too late or not, we shall not look at the ground but raise our heads, look up and stand tall.

Yes, we may live in a bubble but that shouldn’t be an excuse not to speak up and dream.

Let us protect this planet from the evil in us.__
Let us love what was given to us as a gift.__
Have a wonderful 2021.
