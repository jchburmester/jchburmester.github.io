<br />

every night we leave<br />
leave earth as it is<br />
leave our life as it was<br />
lift off the ground<br />
lift off for another round

every night we say goodbye<br />
say goodbye to our past<br />
say goodbye to what was said, what was asked<br />
sing the final melody of the day<br />
sing to sleep our farewell

every night we accept<br />
accept every thing, and every trait<br />
accept our time, accept our fate<br />
ask to leave the shore<br />
ask no one for no more

every night we harvest<br />
harvest moments and synthesise<br />
harvest feelings and symphasise<br />
hope for greater, hope for boon<br />
hope for later, hope for tune

every night we guess<br />
guess how it all turns out<br />
guess where to go and where to doubt<br />
glimpse at what else is there<br />
glimpse at why we should or shouldn't care

every night we dream<br />
dream of other seas, of other kinds<br />
dream in soulmates of our minds<br />
dare to test what else could be<br />
dare to lose and break us free

every night we arrive<br />
arrive at a fresh and free site<br />
arrive with flash, in a new light<br />
ain't it be valiant, ain't it be vast<br />
ain't it be different from the last.
