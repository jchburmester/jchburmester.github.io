<div align="left">we live outside our sense and spirit
<div align="left">outside a world full of doubts and limit
<div align="left">inside our thought, inside our speech
<div align="left">inside our reason, inside our reach
<div align="left">what else is there that we could know?
<div align="left">what else can we think, where else can we go?<
<div align="left">a small idea for us to grow
<div align="left">a short time for us to glow.

<br />

<div align="right">we live inside our doubts and limit
<div align="right">inside a world full of sense and spirit
<div align="right">outside our thought, outside our speech
<div align="right">outside our reason, outside our reach
<div align="right">what else is there that we can't grasp?
<div align="right">what else is there that we should ask?
<div align="right">a small glimpse for us to see
<div align="right">a short time for us to be.<br />
