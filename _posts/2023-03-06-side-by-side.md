<br />

we live outside our sense and spirit<br />
outside a world full of doubts and limit<br />
inside our thought, inside our speech<br />
inside our reason, inside our reach<br />
what else is there that we could know?<br />
what else can we think, where else can we go?<br />
a small idea for us to grow<br />
a short time for us to glow.

<div align="right">inside a world full of sense and spirit

<div align="right">outside our thought, outside our speech<br />
<div align="right">outside our reason, outside our reach

<div align="right">what else is there that we can't grasp?<br />
<div align="right">what else is there that we should ask?<br />
<div align="right">a small glimpse for us to see<br />
<div align="right">a short time for us to be.<br />
