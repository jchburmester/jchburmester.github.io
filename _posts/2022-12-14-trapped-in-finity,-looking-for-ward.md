<br />

trapped in finity<br />
trapped for a while<br />
looking for a moment<br />
looking for a smile

trapped in space<br />
trapped in a flaw<br />
looking for a reason<br />
looking in awe

trapped in site<br />
trapped in a thought<br />
looking for a way out<br />
looking for fraught

trapped in form<br />
trapped in accord<br />
looking for a feeling<br />
looking for ward.
