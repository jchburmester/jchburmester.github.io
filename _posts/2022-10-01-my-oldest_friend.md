<br />

panic, a burst of fear<br />
sudden flash, sudden tear<br />
turn around, turn to me<br />
have to go, have to flee

with me since day one<br />
you make me rush, you make me run

not shy, often shun<br />
you make me hush, you make me stun

blushless as a thief<br />
you make me flag, you make me grieve

dead of night, past eve<br />
you make me lag, you make me leave

panic, a burst of fear<br />
sudden flash, sudden tear<br />
turn around, turn to me<br />
have to go, have to flee

when I change, you change<br />
one moment, I admire you<br />
one moment, you act strange

where I go, you go<br />
had hoped for my own path but<br />
you belong here, I know

we arrived together, had never met<br />
a friend like you is hard to get<br />
stranded here, hand in hand<br />
you watch me until the end.
