<br />

imagine a day as a child<br />
running around, nosy and wild<br />
instant after instant you clutched<br />
flower after flower you touched

although vigour was plenty<br />
you felt weary, worn-out and empty<br />
little wonder, at fainting light<br />
you welcomed and craved for the night<br />

at a time<br />
when you did not know<br />
at a time<br />
when you did not care<br />
but now you do<br />
and now you scare<br />

imagine your last sleep<br />
final, endless and deep<br />
year after year you drudged<br />
thought after thought you jugded

when life was plenty<br />
when you feel weary, worn-out and empty<br />
will you fear the descend<br />
or will you welcome and crave for the end?
