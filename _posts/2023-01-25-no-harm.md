<br />

light,<br />
morning patrol<br />
lift for your head<br />
lift for your soul

grass,<br />
sharp and intense<br />
tickle for your shin<br />
tickle for your sense

birds,<br />
chirp and chat to mates<br />
tune for your ears<br />
tune for your traits

sunshine,<br />
contrast causing art<br />
warmth for your skin<br />
warmth for your heart

wind,<br />
touch of distant visit<br />
shift for your feet<br />
shift for your spirit

clouds,<br />
form distinct views<br />
play for your eyes<br />
play for your muse

rain,<br />
drops from the past<br />
soak for your face<br />
soak for your cast

forests,<br />
rich in tree and flower<br />
essence for your breath<br />
essence for your power

darkness,<br />
plain and hidden aligned<br />
rest for your bones<br />
rest for your mind

nature,<br />
oh nature.<br />
words will never do<br />
no harm for giving <br />
no harm for you.
