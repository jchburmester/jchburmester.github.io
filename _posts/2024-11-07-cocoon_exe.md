<br />

it begins with a fine, silken coat<br />
the first shelter from a turbulent, crude sap<br />
home to fibers, organelles, all afloat<br />
a strange, diverse set this is - a trap?

soon after, gates open, channels to sneak out<br />
hot trades of liquor, snacks full of proteins<br />
feeding those at the junctions - a feisty crowd<br />
primed to mingle, bond with loose, fit genes.

verdant, vulnerable, but with matching ambitions<br />
set off some gangs, crawl up and shape a body<br />
stretching skins, walls; hoarding blood, munitions<br />
the open: bright and lush, yet ruthless, and muddy.

then again, we absorb, expand, never arrive<br />
perch in smart cells, that open with a beep<br />
gather where one of our senses is still alive<br />
when the rest has gone to sleep.

we cater for the core, our sacred nucleus<br />
feed off sprints, plan, and optimise<br />
boosting intel, our state-of-the-art deus<br />
an unseen, complex set this is - a rise?

next up, forking membrane and mind<br />
perhaps both will survive, perhaps neither<br />
full circuit to a novel, larger kind<br />
we can't help it, and life can't either.
